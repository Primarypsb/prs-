The task focuses on **multi-object 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG)** based on **a single monocular RGB image**, enabling machines to interpret complex scenes and spatial relationships using natural language.



## 🧠 Task Description
Given a monocular RGB image and a complex language description (e.g., *"find the red cup on the left side of the table and the black keyboard on the right side"*),  
the goal is to predict **each referred object’s**:
- 3D position (x, y, z)
- 3D size (width, height, depth)
- Orientation (rotation angle)

## 🚧 Core Challenges
- Multi-object scene parsing  
- Spatial relationship modeling  
- Accurate 3D property estimation  

## 📂 Code Release
We have **open-sourced part of our implementation** to help the community explore and reproduce results.  
You are encouraged to:

- Reproduce and verify the released modules  
- Implement or improve other components  
- Contribute new ideas for monocular 3D visual grounding  

## 🤝 Contribution
We welcome open discussions, reproduction efforts, and performance comparisons.  
Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests to share your work.
